# The problem of the problems

Bear in mind that this comes after 11 months of problem research. In 20 years, I will have done 20 years and 11 months of problem research on this topic. Because you cannot stop researching the problems in the world of entrepreneurship. So it starts.

There was a time when business opportunities overcame problem-solving. But it was a time of unlimited resources, short lifespan and little industrialisation. Since Y Combinator came into existence, problem-solving has become the first and only task for startups to achieve Product-Market Fit. After obsession with it(whether I’ve been successful or not), we can extract some conclusions.

The science community fixates on first principles as action-reaction. That’s more or less defining the paradigm of causality. The chain goes like this: causes, problem, consequences. Each problem can have multiple causes and consequences. But the consequence is to the problem what the problem is to the cause. I’ll illustrate it with a with examples.

When an apple is rotten, it has an explanation. It can be whether you forgot to eat it, or because it was already rotten. But both those causes have its own causes. You could have forgotten because you bought too many apples and that was the last one. Or you could have forgotten because you went on a trip. Or it could be both. Equally, or partially distributed. A problem could be due to 10% the trip and 90% due to buying many apples. Or viceversa. Or any other statistical combination you can imagine. And this can be parametrised to the infinite. Every problem can have infinite causes statistically distributed.

I called this infinite causality. Others call it statistics.

So here comes the factor of link length. The more direct the nodes are the stronger the conclusions can be, hence its problem-solving performance. And cause-problem-consequences are all links. As you can see, there’s much relevance between this and the sociology phenomenons of network effects.

And the big question is: what is the problem then? The one you choose to pick.

And why am I writing this today even if I had this theorised 2 months ago? Because I had yet to discover something. What place each cause-problem-consequence relation had in the business world.

We apply the following principles:

Problem should be iterated the least, because it’s what drives an entire organization

You should attack in the root causes because it gives you a competitive advantage with barrier entries

You have to sell how you’re the hero of the consequences that are happening right now

And one last bit is that you can also sell yourself as the hero of their problem. However, it depends on the awareness distribution of your potential clients. That means, if you have to educate them, enlighten them up with what it’s causing them. If they already know the consequences, you can go straight to the problem.

Might take a life-long work to finish this theory.
