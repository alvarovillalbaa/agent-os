The term “unicorn” originates in its rareness. Almost like something magical just happened. But I somehow believe that it can be reverse engineered. So that’s what I tried — meaning lots of time in the drawing board.

When I started studying finances and economics, I thought my passion for them was in its importance. I now realize that it came from an operational execution standpoint. I usually analyzed why liquidity events happened, what lead companies to them.

Most of you will think this is a mistake: reverse engineering a startup is no way to go. But in our self-analysis we realised our knowledge about operations and strategy. Users couldn’t pay us (they’re unemployed), let’s go B2B. But with one main difference.

I believe once you have that, is a matter of prioritization — should be highly embedded in the organizations’ culture. And those priorities should change depending on your product, validation and go-to-market maturity levels. We now priroritize:

1. Problem
2. Product: automatically creating value in the long-term
3. Finances: capturing and re-deploying value as fast as we can

x months after raising pre-seed, we only seek achieving PMF (since our inception really).
