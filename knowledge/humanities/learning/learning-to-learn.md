Previous to this I wrote everywhere. But I want to be read. So I’m trying to allocate those writings. Some of them are in my handbook journal. Even the saddest ones.

I’ve had many realizations that I’ve now assumed, so they’re hard to remember. I’ll introduce previous realizations as I move forward journaling about new ones.

Right now, I have Reminders, Notes, Journals, Obsidian and Notion. Obsidian is for life-long personal knowledge and Notion for productivity knowledge.

Simply by reflecting one can learn a lot if possessing a really analytical mind. Most comes from auto-criticism, some skepticism.
