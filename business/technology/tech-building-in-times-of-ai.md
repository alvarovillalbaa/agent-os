Open-source guardrails and low-inference cloud (Groq) provides IaaS independence to safety, avoiding incumbents lock-in. Cloud and Intelligence providers should be independent.

Open-source AI/ML/code is advancing faster than ever due to x3 productivity in developers. White-collar workers are the one being replaced until AI robotics come after blue-collar.

Energy consumption is the strongest constraint right now, being intelligence progress quite advanced in closed models. Open-source should catch up.

Investment is dry at all levels. The macroeconomic conditions are such mixture of after-.com bubble and after-household crisis. We’ll see more acceleration. Wealth gap has widen and money will be deployed if the engines don’t stall. There’s somehow still a risk of panic selling unless AI’s value creation is enough for capture.

AI adoption is currently on the horizontal use cases across businesses’ boards. Last year was playtesting. There is already a productivity gap. Developers have adopted it first, with maturing sales and market AI markets for SMBs and lower. Enterprise sales won’t change too much due to the intrinsic personal value. HR seems the same. Recruitment comes next. But it’s being adopted by (a) innovators (b) low-sized market.

There’s no one building hardcore AI products. That means AI by design. They normally start with one use case. UI has radically change. UI has reached maturity to an obsoleting level.

Data is still the MOAT of many recruitment agencies.

Software developers aren’t able to catch up with interfaces that are dynamically valuable.

My cross-field knowledge might give me a unique perspective about these.
